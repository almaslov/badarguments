# An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments

_Bad Arguments_ has been read by nearly two million visitors since its release in July 2013. This repository will contain the code and documentation for the project, as of October 2015, which coincides with the first major update to the website since its release on July 2013. This update cleans up the code and makes it mobile-friendly.

### How to contribute

I'm grateful to anyone wishing to contribute to the project. If you wish to translate the book to a new language, you're welcome to contact me privately and send me the translated text and captions in a document. I can then take care of porting everything to the website. That is what we've been doing so far.

Alternatively, you may wish to download the code for an existing translation, modify it, and then send me your work along with the new captions as a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). You can find all existing languages in the repository as top-level directories, identified with their two-letter ISO 639-1 code (e.g. pt, es, he).

You are welcome to suggest corrections or submit suggestions by opening an issue or by submitting a Pull Request using the controls on the right-hand side of this page.

### Existing translations

I'll be rolling out the updated design and code to all the translations over the coming few days.
